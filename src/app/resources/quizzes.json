      "content": "Difficult to defend against user malpractice\nFirst, it is challenging to defend against data privacy malpractices, abuse and theft coming from insiders. The insider element is responsible for 95% of all cybersecurity incidents. And while organizations can introduce limitations to reduce the insider related data privacy risk, they may have limited visibility and control over third-party data privacy malpractices and violations. It is possible that third-party access may be legitimate and necessary to deliver a required business service, but regulations such as GDPR require businesses to maintain unprecedented visibility into data handling by third-party services.\nTake a data-centric and zero-trust approach to address these limitations. It requires consolidated controls and intelligence into all processes, handling and modification of data workloads:\nContinuously assess the trust by evaluating how third-party tools and API requests are processed and used to interact with sensitive customer data.\nEstablish security measures that can dynamically assign security policies and controls to individual data workloads.\nUse data loss prevention (DLP) tools to reduce the risk of a data breach. Additionally, encrypt sensitive information to help eliminate risk of misuse against compromised user data.",

This lack of awareness makes it difficult for data breaches to be resolved.\nFortunately, there are several steps businesses can take to detect a data breach sooner. Businesses should invest in governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) and hire cybersecurity analysts to routinely monitor their security practices.

Respondents included more than 200 C-level IT and IT security executives in organizations with an average of 21,300 employees across a wide range of industries.\nAt a top level, the survey found that 78% lack confidence in their company’s IT security posture and believe improvements are needed. Respondents expressed the least confidence in their organization’s security roadmap (32%), security-related technology and tools (30%), and internal teams and skill sets (27%). They reported the highest level of trust in their company’s data management strategy, but even then, less than half (45%) voiced confidence in this aspect of security operations.",

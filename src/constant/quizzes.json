    context: "Defending against data privacy issues, including malpractices, abuse, and theft by insiders, presents a significant challenge. Insiders are behind 95% of cybersecurity incidents. While organizations can impose limitations to mitigate risks from insiders, their visibility and control over third-party violations are often restricted. Despite third-party access being crucial for business services, regulations like GDPR mandate businesses to ensure transparency in how third-parties handle data.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, adopt a data-centric and zero-trust strategy, incorporating comprehensive controls and insights across all data processes and modifications. This includes:\n- Continuously evaluating third-party tools and API requests' interaction with sensitive data to assess trust.\n- Implementing security measures that dynamically apply policies and controls to data workloads.\n- Utilizing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools and encrypting sensitive data to minimize breach risks and misuse.\n\nUnderstanding Insider Threats & Their Prevention\nDiscover everything about insider threats and safeguarding your business.\n\nWhat is Insider Threat Prevention?\nIt involves proactive measures to protect company data from threats posed by individuals with internal access, focusing on data protection through threat detection and identification.\n\nExamples of Insider Threats\nThese threats range from malicious to accidental actions leading to data loss, such as sending sensitive data to incorrect recipients, unprotected data sharing, or data theft for financial gain.\n\nIndicators of Insider Threats\nSigns include unauthorized privilege escalation, actions beyond one’s role, abnormal data activities like excessive downloads, and a demeanor that’s anxious or aloof.\n\nPreventing Insider Threats\nThis can be achieved through a strategy focused on early identification and detection, employing tools for monitoring activities and tracking user behaviors on systems.\n\nTop Tools for Detecting Insider Threats\nEffective tools offer insights into user behavior, with analytics on user and entity behaviors, and monitoring of user activities and endpoints, being pivotal for detecting insider threats.",
